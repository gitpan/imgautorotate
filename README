imgautorotate - automatically rotate jpg image guided by exif data

DESCRIPTION
    Uses exiftool to see if an image has orientation set to something. It
    will use mogrify to alter the original images. Non jpeg files (regex)
    are skipped. Any images we can't get info for are failures. The exit
    code is how many failures we have. Skipped arguments are not deemed
    failures.

USAGE
    imgautorotate [OPTIONS].. IMAGEFILE..

       -h          help
       -n          just show the shell commands
       -v          version

  USAGE EXAMPLES
       imgautorotate ./images/*jpg
